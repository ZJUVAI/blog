## Project Background

-   Big data era
-   Tell the data as a news
-   Rapid news production
-   Short Video (easy to share)
-   Propose a novel way to arrange the story as a short video from its data-driven

## General motivation

Is it possible to create a short data-driven video by automatically that can tell its story with its movement like the Hans video?

## The specific problem

-   There are many events, which are suitable to select for representing?
-   When should the data be pointed with the highlight?
-   How to determine an action (effects) to the data movement in the short video
-   Moreover, How can the user arrange their story?

## Proposed Topic

Propose a novel way to extract the movement behaviour of each data (hashtag) and then tell the story from the data (hashtags) behaviour and export as a short video that is easy to publish

## Research Content

Label the level of the data cluster, the level can be used to determine the movement of the data (hashtag), the label can tell;

-   which data (hashtag) should be highlighted
-   when the video should be paused (based on highlighted data condition)
-   The transition of the data (hashtags) that can adjust the speed transition
-   The critical period (event) of the whole timeline

Our method proposed the way to get the level of data by using K-means clustering

From previous can sum-up as the Story Arrangement comes from;

-   Highlighted Data (Hashtags)
-   Pause
-   Convert Transition to Speed
