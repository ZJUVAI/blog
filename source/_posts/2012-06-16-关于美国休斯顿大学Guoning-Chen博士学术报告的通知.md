**Abstract:**

> Vector fields are commonly used to study various aero- and hydro- dynamical systems that dominate many physical and natural phenomena in the world. Applications that study these dynamical systems, such as computational fluid dynamics, automotive and aircraft design, weather study and oceanography, generate large amounts of vector-valued data that need processing. Flow recurrent dynamics, such as stagnant points and re-circulating flows, are among the most significant flow behaviors for domain experts. Computing vector field topology is an efficient way to detect not only the flow recurrent dynamics but also their connectivity, which in turn partitions the flow domain into smaller regions for easy interpretation. I will show how vector field topology can be defined and computed robustly with the aid of Morse decomposition, a mathematical tool recently introduced to the flow visualization community. Compared to conventional vector field topology that is based on its differential definition, Morse decomposition provides more room to tolerate error and uncertainty introduced during data acquisition and numerical computation, leading to more stable results. In addition, I will demonstrate how the analysis of vector fields can improve their design and control for a wide range of computer graphics applications that need vector fields as the input, such as texture synthesis, non-photo-realistic rendering, geometric modeling and geometry processing, and computer animation.

> Guoning Chen is a postdoctoral research fellow in Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute at the University of Utah. He is joining the University of Houston this fall as an assistant professor. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1999 from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China and a master’s degree in 2002 from Guangxi University, China. In 2009, he earned a PhD degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University. During his master studies, he studied the problem of transaction management for distributed databases. Before attending Oregon State University, he was an instructor in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Guangxi University where he was awarded the first-prize in a teaching contest for young instructors. His current research interests include scientific data visualization and analysis, topological-based method in visualization, geometric modeling and geometry processing, and computer graphics. He has served on the program committees of a number of conferences and reviewed for several journals and conferences. He is a member of the IEEE and ACM.
