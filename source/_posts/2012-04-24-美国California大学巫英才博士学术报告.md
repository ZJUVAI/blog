## Abstract

Visualization is a very powerful tool for physicians, scientists, engineers, and other people to gain insight into their data using interactive computer graphics and imaging techniques. Although some successes have been made, it is still an important and challenging problem to create an effective and trustworthy visualization. In this talk, I will present two of my representative works in scientific visualization and information visualization. The first work is a novel approach for enhancing the effectiveness of direct volume rendered images from the perspective of human perception. It uses a suite of new measures based on well-established psychological principles to evaluate the perceptual quality of transparent structures in the rendered images. The second work is a comprehensive visual analytics system, pinionSeer, to facilitate visual analysis of a large collection of online customer reviews. It employs a set of uncertainty visualization techniques to faithfully model and analyze customer opinions to ensure the trustworthiness of the results.
